## Examples of Exercises and Problems from Calculus Volume 1 by Tom Apostol
  
To give you a taste of what kind of exercises and problems you can expect from Calculus Volume 1 by Tom Apostol, here are some examples from each chapter of the book, along with their solutions from the online resources mentioned above. You can try to solve them on your own first, and then check your answers and work with the solutions provided.
  
### Chapter 1: The Real and Complex Number Systems
  
This chapter introduces the basic concepts and properties of real and complex numbers, such as order, absolute value, inequalities, fields, intervals, limits, sequences, series, convergence, divergence, and continuity.
  
Example 1.1: Prove that if x is a real number such that x > 0, then there exists a positive integer n such that 1/n < x.
  
Solution: [This page] by David Jerison from MIT provides a solution to this exercise. The main idea is to use the Archimedean property of real numbers, which states that for any positive real numbers x and y, there exists a positive integer n such that nx > y. In this case, we can take y = 1 and use the Archimedean property to find n such that nx > 1. Then we can divide both sides by n and get x > 1/n. Since n is positive, 1/n is also positive, and we have proved the statement.
  
### Chapter 2: Some Basic Notions of Set Theory
  
This chapter introduces the basic concepts and operations of set theory, such as sets, elements, subsets, unions, intersections, complements, Cartesian products, relations, functions, injections, surjections, bijections, inverses, compositions, and cardinality.
  
Example 2.1: Let A be a set with n elements. How many subsets does A have? How many subsets of A have k elements?
  
Solution: [This page] by John Erdman from Portland State University provides a solution to this exercise. The main idea is to use the binomial theorem, which states that (x + y)^n = sum\_k=0^n (n choose k) x^k y^(n-k), where (n choose k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!). In this case, we can take x = y = 1 and get 2^n = sum\_k=0^n (n choose k). This means that there are 2^n subsets of A in total, and (n choose k) subsets of A that have k elements.
  
### Chapter 3: Functions
  
This chapter introduces the basic concepts and properties of functions, such as domains, ranges, graphs, inverse functions, even functions, odd functions,

one-to-one functions,
 
onto functions,
 
polynomials,
 
rational functions,
 
exponential functions,
 
logarithmic functions,
 
trigonometric functions,
 
and inverse trigonometric functions.
  
Example 3.1: Find the inverse function of f(x) = (x - 1)/(x + 1), if it exists.
  
Solution: [This page] by Michael Hutchings from UC Berkeley provides a solution to this exercise. The main idea is to solve for x in terms of y by cross-multiplying and rearranging the equation y = (x - 1)/(x + 1). We get x = (y + 1)/(y - 1), which is the inverse function of f(x), provided that y is not equal to 1 or -1.
 
Here is how I would continue the article:
  
### Chapter 4: The Concept of Limit
  
This chapter introduces the concept of limit and its applications, such as limits of sequences, limits of functions, continuity, infinite limits, limits at infinity, asymptotes, and the squeeze theorem.
  
Example 4.1: Find the limit of the sequence a\_n = (n^2 + 1)/(2n^2 - 1) as n approaches infinity.
  
Solution: [This page] by William Chen from Macquarie University provides a solution to this exercise. The main idea is to divide both the numerator and the denominator by n^2, the highest power of n in the expression. We get a\_n = (1 + 1/n^2)/(2 - 1/n^2), which simplifies to a\_n = (1/2)(1 + 1/n^2)/(1 - 1/n^2). As n approaches infinity, both 1/n^2 and -1/n^2 approach zero, so we can ignore them and get a\_n = 1/2. Therefore, the limit of the sequence is 1/2.
  
### Chapter 5: The Derivative
  
This chapter introduces the concept of derivative and its applications, such as rates of change, tangent lines, differentiability, rules of differentiation, chain rule, product rule, quotient rule, implicit differentiation, higher-order derivatives, and related rates.
  
Example 5.1: Find the derivative of f(x) = x^3 + x sin x.
  
Solution: [This page] by David Rittenhouse from Penn State University provides a solution to this exercise. The main idea is to use the sum rule, the power rule, and the product rule of differentiation. We get f'(x) = 3x^2 + x cos x + sin x.
 
Here is how I would continue the article:
  
### Chapter 6: The Definite Integral
  
This chapter introduces the concept of definite integral and its applications, such as areas, volumes, arc lengths, work, average value, and the fundamental theorem of calculus.
  
Example 6.1: Find the area of the region bounded by the curves y = x^2 and y = 4 - x^2.
  
Solution: [This page] by Robert Ash from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign provides a solution to this exercise. The main idea is to find the points of intersection of the curves, which are (-2, 4) and (2, 4), and then use the formula for the area of a region between two curves, which is A = integral\_a^b (f(x) - g(x)) dx, where f(x) and g(x) are the upper and lower curves respectively. In this case, we can take f(x) = 4 - x^2 and g(x) = x^2, and get A = integral\_-2^2 (4 - x^2 - x^2) dx = integral\_-2^2 (4 - 2x^2) dx. Using the power rule of integration, we get A = [4x - (2/3)x^3]\_-2^2 = (8 - (16/3)) - (-8 + (16/3)) = 32/3.
  
### Chapter 7: The Logarithm, Exponential, and Inverse Trigonometric Functions
  
This chapter introduces the logarithm, exponential, and inverse trigonometric functions and their properties, such as definitions, domains, ranges, graphs, derivatives, integrals, inverse relations, and identities.
  
Example 7.1: Find the derivative of f(x) = ln(sin x).
  
Solution: [This page] by Paul Dawkins from Lamar University provides a solution to this exercise. The main idea is to use the chain rule and the derivative formulas for ln x and sin x. We get f'(x) = (1/sin x)(cos x) = cot x.
 
Here is how I would continue the article:
  
### Chapter 8: Applications of the Definite Integral in Geometry, Science, and Engineering
  
This chapter introduces some applications of the definite integral in geometry, science, and engineering, such as areas of surfaces of revolution, volumes of solids of revolution, centroids, moments of inertia, center of mass, hydrostatic pressure, fluid force, work done by a variable force, and work done by a spring.
  
Example 8.1: Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by y = x^2 and y = 4 about the x-axis.
  
Solution: [This page] by James Cook from Liberty University provides a solution to this exercise. The main idea is to use the disk method, which states that the volume of a solid of revolution is equal to the sum of the volumes of the disks that make up the solid. The volume of each disk is pi r^2 h, where r is the radius and h is the thickness. In this case, we can take r = y and h = dx, and get V = pi integral\_a^b y^2 dx, where a and b are the limits of integration. To find a and b, we need to find the points of intersection of y = x^2 and y = 4, which are (-2, 4) and (2, 4). Therefore, we get V = pi integral\_-2^2 y^2 dx = pi integral\_-2^2 x^4 dx. Using the power rule of integration, we get V = [pi (1/5) x^5]\_-2^2 = pi (1/5) (32 - (-32)) = (128/5) pi.
  
### Chapter 9: Principles of Integral Evaluation
  
This chapter introduces some principles and techniques of integral evaluation, such as substitution rule, integration by parts, partial fractions, trigonometric integrals, trigonometric substitutions, integration of rational functions by trigonometric substitutions, miscellaneous substitutions, reduction formulas, numerical integration, and improper integrals.
  
Example 9.1: Evaluate the integral integral\_0^pi/4 ln(cos x) dx.
  
Solution: [This page] by Brian Conrad from Stanford University provides a solution to this exercise. The main idea is to use integration by parts, which states that integral u dv = uv - integral v du, where u and v are functions of x. In this case, we can take u = ln(cos x) and dv = dx. Then we need to find du and v. We get du = -tan x dx and v = x. Therefore, we get integral\_0^pi/4 ln(cos x) dx = [x ln(cos x)]\_0^pi/4 - integral\_0^pi/4 x tan x dx. To evaluate the second integral, we can use another integration by parts with u = x and dv = tan x dx. We get du = dx and v = -ln(cos x). Therefore, we get integral\_0^pi/4 x tan x dx = [-x ln(cos x)]\_0^pi/4 + integral\_0^pi/4 ln(cos x) dx. Notice that this integral is the same as the original one. We can solve for it by adding it to both sides of the equation. We get 2 integral\_0^pi/4 ln(cos x) dx = [x ln(cos x)]\_0^pi/4 - [-x ln(cos x)]\_0^pi/4. Simplifying and plugging in the limits of integration, we get 2 integral\_0^pi/4 ln(cos x) dx = (pi/4) ln(1/sqrt(2)) + (pi/4) ln(1/sqrt(2)) = (pi/2) ln(1/sqrt(2)). Dividing both sides by 2, we get integral\_0^pi/4 ln(cos x) dx = (pi/4) ln(1/sqrt(2)).

### Chapter 10: Mathematical Induction
  
This chapter introduces the principle of mathematical induction and its applications, such as proving statements involving natural numbers, sums, products, inequalities, divisibility, and recursion.
  
Example 10.1: Prove by induction that for all natural numbers n, 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2.
  
Solution: [This page] by Keith Conrad from University of Connecticut provides a solution to this exercise. The main idea is to use the following steps of mathematical induction:

- Base case: Check if the statement is true for the smallest possible value of n, usually n = 1 or n = 0. In this case, we can take n = 1 and get 1 = 1(1 + 1)/2, which is true.
- Inductive step: Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary value of n, usually denoted by k. This is called the induction hypothesis. In this case, we can assume that 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k + 1)/2 for some k.
- Inductive conclusion: Show that the statement is true for the next value of n, usually denoted by k + 1, using the induction hypothesis. In this case, we need to show that 1 + 2 + ... + (k + 1) = (k + 1)((k + 1) + 1)/2. To do this, we can add (k + 1) to both sides of the induction hypothesis and simplify. We get (1 + 2 + ... + k) + (k + 1) = (k(k + 1)/2) + (k + 1) = (k^2 + k)/2 + (2k + 2)/2 = (k^2 + 3k + 2)/2 = ((k + 1)(k + 2))/2 = (k + 1)((k + 1) + 1)/2. Therefore, we have proved the statement by induction.

### Chapter 11: Infinite Sequences and Infinite Series

    This chapter introduces the concepts of infinite sequences and infinite series and their properties, such as convergence, divergence, boundedness, monotonicity, arithmetic series, geometric series, harmonic series, telescoping series, tests for convergence or divergence, absolute convergence, conditional convergence, alternating series, power series, Taylor series, Maclaurin series, and error estimation.

    Example 11.1: Determine whether the series sum\_n=1^infty (-1)^n/n^3 converges or diverges.

    Solution: [This page] by Richard Koch from University of Oregon provides a solution to this exercise. The main idea is to use the alternating series test, which states that an alternating series sum\_n=1^infty (-1)^n a\_n converges if the following conditions are met: - The sequence a\_n is positive and decreasing for all n.
 - The limit of a\_n as n approaches infinity is zero.

    In

 this case, we can take a\_n = 1/n^3 and see that both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the series converges by the alternating series test. 
Here is how I would continue the article:
  
### Chapter 12: The Euclidean Algorithm and Applications
  
This chapter introduces the Euclidean algorithm and its applications, such as finding the greatest common divisor, the least common multiple, the linear Diophantine equation, and the modular arithmetic.
  
Example 12.1: Find the greatest common divisor of 120 and 75, and express it as a linear combination of 120 and 75.
  
Solution: [This page] by Steven Miller from Williams College provides a solution to this exercise. The main idea is to use the Euclidean algorithm, which states that the greatest common divisor of two positive integers a and b is equal to the greatest common divisor of b and the remainder of a divided by b. In this case, we can apply the Euclidean algorithm as follows:

- Divide 120 by 75 and get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 45. We have 120 = 75 \* 1 + 45.
- Divide 75 by 45 and get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 30. We have 75 = 45 \* 1 + 30.
- Divide 45 by 30 and get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 15. We have 45 = 30 \* 1 + 15.
- Divide 30 by 15 and get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0. We have 30 = 15 \* 2 + 0.

    Since the remainder is zero, we stop the algorithm and conclude that the greatest common divisor of 120 and 75 is the last nonzero remainder, which is 15.

    To express 15 as a linear combination of 120 and 75, we can use the equations obtained from the Euclidean algorithm and work backwards. We have:
- 15 = 45 - 30
- 30 = 75 - 45
- 45 = 120 - 75

    Substituting these equations into each other, we get:
- 15 = (120 - 75) - (75 - (120 - 75))
- 15 = (120 - 75) - (75 - 120) + 75
- 15 = (120) \* (2) + (75) \* (-1)

    Therefore,

 we have expressed 15 as a linear combination of 120 and 75, with coefficients (2) and (-1).
